# Iris Flower Classification with Machine Learning
This repository implements machine learning algorithms to classify Iris flower species based on petal and sepal measurements from the Iris dataset, a classic dataset in machine learning.

# Features:

# Machine Learning Algorithms:
Supports various algorithms like K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), or Decision Trees for classification.
Users can experiment with different algorithms to find the best performing one for this dataset.
# Data Exploration:
Provides visualizations and analysis of the Iris dataset to understand the distribution of features and potential relationships between them.
# Model Evaluation:
Employs standard metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess model performance.
Visualizations of confusion matrices or ROC curves can be included for further evaluation.
